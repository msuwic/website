                            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Sanju Kona and I am excited to serve as WIC's President this year! I am a senior studying Computer Science with a cognate in Information and Media, and this is my fourth year in WIC! 
                               I chose to major in CS because I love how diverse technology is, as well as how impactful it can be. I love learning about the different uses and applications of technology in different industries!
                               My career interests include Software Engineering and Cybersecurity. Outside of WIC, I have been involved in Women In Engineering, a Spartan Girls Who Code Mentor, and part of the Coalition of Indian Undergraduate Students. 
                               In my free time I like to play tennis, go for walks outside on MSU's beautiful campus, and attend sports games! I can't wait to see what WIC accomplishes this year! 
                               If you have any questions or want to connect, don't hesitate to reach out!

                                Hi! My name is Sanaye Lewis, and I am excited to be this year's Vice President. 
                                I love coming to WIC every week, and I love the incredible community we have. 
                                Outside of WIC I am an ambassador for Women In Engineering K-12 Outreach, and a lead admin for their coding programs. 
                                In my free time I love to dance, watch musicals, and eat cheese!
                            </p>
                            <!-- <p>
                                Outside of WIC, I’m a lead mentor for Girls Who Code and Technovation and also do research in the BEACON 
                                center here at MSU. I’ve also have had the privilege to intern at Leidos as a software engineer.
                                In addition to being a member of WIC, I am also a member of Phi Sigma Rho engineering sorority.

                                Hey, my name is Tanvi, and I will be treasurer for WIC 2024-2025 school year. 
                                I’m a junior studying Computer Science with a minor in business. I am a first-generation college student! 
                                I am involved in MSU various ways, I work as the Lead at the Resource Center for TRIO SSS, an undergraduate learning assistant for UGS 110, and a STEM tutor for TRIO SSS. 
                                I work part-time during the school year as a Data Analyst Intern for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM), and I am the co-founder of a start-up at MSU called BRCĒ. 
                                In the summer of 2024, I have interned with Caterpillar Inc. as their Business Intelligence and Business Operations Commercial Analyst in Peoria, IL. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my free time I enjoy reading, trying new restaurants, and listening to crime documentaries. My favorite part of WIC is the community and the people. 
                                I am so excited to contribute to the organization that gave so much to me :)

                            <p>Hello! My name is Sitara Baxendale and I am an incoming junior here at MSU studying Computer Science Engineering with a minor in Cognitive Science. 
                                I chose to study CSE because of my passion for coding and the versatility the degree offers in career paths post graduation! 
                                I am currently a Admin for the Women in Engineering Outreach Office for K-12 Coding Camps here on campus. 
                                Furthermore, this summer 2024 I am interning at Bank of America in Charlotte, NC as a Software Engineering Intern. 
                                My favorite part about WIC is meeting and becoming friends with girls in the same field as I, as well as the opportunities the club provides such as meeting with companies and attending conferences. 
                                With that, my favorite WIC memory is the 2023 Grace Hopper Conference!

                                I am in my third year at MSU studying Computational Data Science. Along with classes, I am an undergraduate learning assistant for MTH 314. 
                                Outside of school, I participate in IM sports, run, play the ukulele, and am trying to teach myself to play guitar. 
                                I am so excited to be a part of the E-Board this year, and I love being a part of the WIC community. 
                                I hope everyone will be able to feel all of the support and community that WIC has to offer, and please reach out if you ever need anything!

                                I am a Sophomore at MSU majoring in Computer Science. Outside of school, I enjoy traveling, making polymer clay charms, and spending time with friends and family.

                                I'm excited to continue my journey with WIC, the computer science field, embrace new challenges, and make meaningful contributions within WIC. 
                                I am looking forward to working with you all in the next year!

                                Hi everyone! My name is Sarika Kona, and I’m the Social Chair for WIC this year! I’m a sophomore majoring in Computer Science. 
                                One of my favorite things about WIC is the strong sense of community—it’s great to be part of such a supportive group with amazing people. 
                                My favorite WIC memory is our trampoline park event; it was such a fun way to connect with everyone! Outside of WIC, I love playing tennis, pickleball, and hanging out with friends. 
                                I’m excited to create more memorable experiences for our WIC members this year and help make our community even stronger. 
                                I can’t wait to see what we accomplish together!
