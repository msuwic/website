                <p>
                    On behalf of MSU WIC, I would like to express our gratitude to all of our industry partners, the Computer Science and Engineering 
                    Department, the Women in Engineering Program, and the College of Engineering for their continued support this year. There are not 
                    enough words to express how much your support impacts and improves all of the programs and opportunities that MSU WIC offers its members. 
                    Your continued support during these uncertain times has not gone unnoticed and has allowed us to continue working towards our mission of 
                    empowering and encouraging young women to discover a love for computing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would not be able to be a part of the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing without you all. Your contributions have provided women 
                    in the CSE program at MSU the opportunity to be a part of an international community of empowered female technologists. This conference allows our 
                    members the opportunity to not only attend technical talks and expand their technical knowledge, but also network with other attendees and explore 
                    vast career opportunities. This year, we were able to sponsor 17 students to attend virtual GHC 2021. GHC 2022 has been announced as a hybrid event, 
                    and we look forward to attending.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even outside of the Grace Hopper Conference, your contributions help us organize our weekly meetings. Our meetings include technical talks, resume workshops, 
                    Lean In circles, social events and more – all of which help our members develop various skills helpful after graduation. Ultimately, your generous contributions 
                    help make WIC what it is today – a source of friendship, support, and countless wonderful memories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we were able to host the second annual MSU WIC Career Fair in Fall 2021. This virtual event helped connect our members to employment opportunities with our industry partners.
                     We look forward to partnering with The Center for Spartan Engineering to host this career fair again this fall.
                </p>
                <p>MSU WIC partnered with the following technology leaders in offering these opportunities to students:
                </p>
                <p><strong>Gold</strong>: GM | Domino's | Quicken Loans </p>
                <p><strong>Silver</strong>: MSUFCU | Dow | BP | Atomic Object </p>
                <p><strong>Bronze</strong>: Target | Deloitte | General Mills | Elektrobit | Delta Dental </p>
                <p>Thank you for everything! We look forward to future engagement opportunities with you, whether that is in-person or virtually!</p>

                    <p>On behalf of MSU WIC, I would like to express our gratitude to all of our industry partners, the 
                        Computer Science and Engineering Department, the Women in Engineering Program, and the College of 
                        Engineering for their continued support this year. There are not enough words to express how much 
                        your support impacts and improves all of the programs and opportunities that MSU WIC offers its members.</p>
                    <p>We would not be able to be a part of the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing without 
                        you all. Your contributions have provided women in the CSE program at MSU the opportunity to be a
                         part of an international community of empowered female technologists. This conference allows our 
                         members the opportunity to not only attend technical talks and expand their technical knowledge, 
                         but also network with other attendees and explore vast career opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Even outside of the Grace Hopper Conference, your contributions help us organize our weekly meetings.
                         Our meetings include technical talks, resume workshops, Lean In circles, social events and more – all 
                         of which help our members develop various skills helpful after graduation. Ultimately, your generous 
                         contributions help make WIC what it is today – a source of friendship, support and countless wonderful
                          memories.</p>
                    <p>MSU WIC partnered with the following technology leaders in offering these opportunities to students:
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Gold</strong>: GM</p>

                <p>Michigan State University Women in Computing (MSU WIC) offers many ways for its members to connect
                    with each other and the community. This past year, WIC members attended conferences, supported each
                    other in Lean In circles and participated in outreach programs! As president, I enjoyed
                    participating and witnessing WIC evolve and grow to offer new opportunities to both current members
                    as well as to young girls in the community. This annual report highlights some of the opportunities
                    WIC participated in to increase membership and engage current members.</p>
                <p>MSU WIC is a community of women and men who are passionate not only about technology and computer
                    science, but also about increasing the number of women and other underrepresented groups in
                    technology. To foster and grow our community this year, we emphasized recruiting and retaining
                    first-and second-year students. Senior WIC members purposely engaged junior members at WIC meetings
                    and organized a meeting in which they advised junior members about courses. We believe that
                    establishing a strong support network early in a student’s college career aids the student in
                    successfully completing her chosen degree program.</p>
                <p>This academic year, MSU WIC members attended the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing
                    (GHC). Thanks to the financial support from industry partners and from the University, 27 MSU WIC
                    members attended GHC in Orlando, Florida. At GHC, MSU WIC members had the opportunity to network
                    with other women in computer science, attend tech talks on diverse topics within computer science,
                    and hear keynote speeches from inspirational women such as Melinda Gates and Dr. Ayanna Howard.</p>
                <p>In addition to supporting women and underrepresented groups interested in computing at the college
                    level, many MSU WIC members also participated in K-12 outreach programs. This year, MSU WIC created
                    the Spartan Girls Who Code Club, which is now home to over 40 students, 17 mentors and 2 Michigan
                    State University faculty members who serve as advisors. The students are from middle and high
                    schools in the surrounding areas, which is broken down into a junior club for students in grades 6-7
                    and a senior club for students in grades 8-11. The goal of the club is to expose students to the
                    foundations of programming and critical problem solving with the ultimate goal of not only
                    encouraging more females in STEM related fields, but also providing them with an empowering
                    community of women technologists. Not only were younger students exposed to computing topics and a
                    supportive environment, but MSU WIC members learned how to convey computer science topics in a
                    comprehensible manner by planning and executing lessons and activities. Many MSU WIC members also
                    served as volunteers for recruiting and outreach events hosted by the University.</p>
                <p>MSU WIC partnered with the following technology leaders in offering these opportunities to students:
                </p>
                <p><strong>Gold</strong>: GM | Vertafore | ASMSU</p>
                <p><strong>Silver</strong>: Target | Crowe Horwath | Dow Corning</p>
                <p><strong>Bronze</strong>: Blue Medora</p>
                <p>On behalf of MSU WIC, I would like to express our gratitude to all of our industry partners, the
                    Computer Science and Engineering Department, and the College of Engineering for their continued
                    support this year. There are not enough words to express how much their support impacts and improves
                    all of the programs and opportunities that MSU WIC offers its members. I would also like to thank
                    our alumni for helping WIC become what it is today. For our current and future members, I hope WIC
                    continues to be as significant to you as it was to me during my four years of college: a source of
                    friendship, support, and countless memories.</p>
